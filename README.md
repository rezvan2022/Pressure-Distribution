# Pressure-Distribution
This repository contains MATLAB code for analyzing pressure distribution data and calculating lift coefficients in aerodynamic studies. The code processes experimental data from pressure sensors on airfoils, calculates pressure coefficients, and estimates lift coefficients using numerical integration techniques.

Key Features:

Reads pressure distribution data from files
Calculates pressure coefficients and lift coefficients
Visualizes pressure distribution and lift coefficient results
Handles error estimation for pressure coefficients
Supports customization for different airfoil configurations and experimental setups
Usage:

Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository directory.
Run the main script main_script.m to execute the analysis.
View the generated figures for pressure distribution and lift coefficient results.
